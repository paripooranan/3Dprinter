# Introduction 
This project aims to build a low cost, highly customizable yet large volume 3D printer that use standard hardware components combined with a few custom printed components. It is an all leadscrew construction and runs on Marlin firmware.

# Components
* Aluminum T slot profile and supporting components( die cast plugs, two way joint, t-nuts)
* Trapezoidal leadscrews(8mm)
* Smooth rods (8mm)
* NEMA 17 stepper motors and stand
* E3D V6 set with PTFE tube, bowden extruder, PLA filament
* Heatbed
* Arduino MEGA, Polulo RAMPS, A4988 stepper drivers
* Power supply(12V/20A)
